            <p> Hello, my name is Dakota Martin. I am an "amature" when it comes to web design. I was never really interested in web design until I took the class when I was a senior in high school. I was more of a PC guy, I enjoyed building computers and was intrigued by all the hardware that makes a computer do what it does. I hope to build PCs as a hobby or even as a job in my future.</p>

          <div class="about-text">
            <p>I am originally from Dayton, Ohio, I lived there until I moved to Tennessee in the eighth grade due to economic hardships. I am an open minded person, I would like to think I am easy to get along with, I can be sarcastic at times, I am a visual learner, and I am attending Wright State University in the fall of 2017, majoring in computer engineering.</p>
